# Tab-cloak

Free to use tab cloak for any purpose! (no seriously I don't care if you use it)

How to use the website version (script.js)

1. Create an html file and get over the basics

2. Then make a <button> tag with the "onclick" command being "onclick="localStorage.setItem('cloak', '(cloak)'),cloakTitle();". (NO BUTTON ID REQUIRED)

3. Make sure that the reset or default button has "location.reload();" instead of "cloakTitle();".

4. Make sure that the title in the head of the website has the id of "cloakable" and the favicon has the id of "cloak".

If you want to use the tab cloak for personal use, your out of luck! I am still working on it. it will be released soon, I promise!
